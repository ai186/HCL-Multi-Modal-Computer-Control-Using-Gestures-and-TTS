1. Hand Gesture and Positioning:
Position your hand in a "victory" gesture, where your palm faces inward and your fingers are slightly spread apart.
Ensure that your hand is within the camera's field of view and clearly visible.

2. Cursor Movement:
Move your hand on the screen to control the cursor's position.
As you move your hand, the cursor will correspondingly move on the screen.
Experiment with different hand movements and find a comfortable and efficient technique for cursor navigation.

3. Typing and Entering Text:
Use the cursor movement and clicking gestures to navigate and enter text as you would with a physical keyboard.
Position your hand over each letter and perform the scissor gesture to input the corresponding characters.
Familiarize yourself with the keyboard layout and practice the clicking gesture for efficient typing.

Virtual Mouse
TYPES
Hand Based Mouse
A virtual mouse using hand recognition is a computer input device that allows users to control the mouse cursor on a screen by using hand gestures and movements, without the need for a physical mouse. This technology utilizes computer vision and image processing techniques to track and interpret the movements of the user's hand.

User Manual Hand-Based Mouse
Thank you for choosing our hand-based mouse. This user manual will guide you on how to effectively use the mouse through touch gestures with your hand and hand movement in front of the camera.

1. Hand Placement:
Place your hand comfortably on a flat surface, ensuring that your fingertips are accessible.
Position your index finger, middle finger, and pinky finger slightly apart from each other.
Rest your thumb near the base of your index finger.

2. Left Click:
To perform a left-click, gently touch your index finger and thumb together.
The touch should be light and brief to register as a left-click action.
Practice the touch gesture to become comfortable and proficient in executing left-clicks accurately.

3. Right Click:
For a right-click, touch your middle finger and thumb together.
Similar to the left click, ensure the touch is gentle and momentary to register as a right-click action.
Familiarize yourself with the touch gesture to consistently perform right-clicks with ease.

4. Double Click:
To execute a double-click, touch your pinky finger and thumb together.
Similar to the previous gestures, maintain a light touch for a brief moment to trigger the double-click action.
Practice the double-click gesture to master the timing required for successful execution.

5. Cursor Movement:
Move your hand gently while keeping your fingers and thumb in the designated positions.
As you move your hand, the cursor on the screen will correspond accordingly.
Experiment with different hand movements and find a comfortable and efficient technique for cursor navigation.

Eye based Mouse
A virtual mouse using eye recognition, also known as eye-gaze or eye-tracking technology, is a system that allows users to control a computer cursor or navigate through a virtual environment using their eye movements. Instead of using a physical mouse or other input devices, the system tracks the movements of the user's eyes and translates them into corresponding actions on the screen.

User Manual Eye-Based Mouse
Thank you for choosing our eye-based mouse. This user manual will guide you on how to effectively use the mouse through eye movements and blinking for clicking actions.

1. Face Placement and Camera Positioning:
Position yourself comfortably in front of the camera, ensuring that your face is adequately framed.
Adjust the camera position, if necessary, to achieve the best tracking results for your eyes and eye movements.

2. Left Click:
To perform a left-click action, blink your left eye once.
Ensure that your blink is deliberate and distinct to register as a left click.
Practice blinking with your left eye to become comfortable and proficient in executing left-click actions accurately.

3. Cursor Movement:
Move your eyes and focus on different areas of the screen to control the cursor.
The right eye's movements will be tracked to determine the cursor's position.
Experiment with different eye movements and find a comfortable and efficient technique for cursor navigation.

4. Face and Eye Placement:
Ensure that your face remains within the designated frame area in front of the camera.
Position your eyes adequately in the frame, allowing for accurate eye tracking and movement detection.
Adjust your position as necessary to maintain consistent tracking and optimal performance.
